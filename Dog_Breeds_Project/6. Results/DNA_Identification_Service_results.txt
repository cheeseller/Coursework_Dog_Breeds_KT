This output is the result of the functions in the:
1. a_Input_from_file.py    ---> to read the dog_breeds.fa and mystery.fa files
2. b_Sequence_Alignment.py ---> for aligning sequences using the pairwise2 function and creating a dictionary with sequences and their corresponding scores
3. c_Match_Scoring.py      ---> to find the best match, its corresponding score and percentage of match.
4. d_Phylogeny_tree.py     ---> to build a phylogenetic tree from the dog breed sequences and includes the mystery sequence.

For more details about the project, refer to the README file.
